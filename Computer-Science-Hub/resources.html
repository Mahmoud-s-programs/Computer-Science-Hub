      <h2>An Open Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms</h2> <!-- Heading -->
      <p>
        This textbook serves as a gentle introduction for undergraduates to
        theoretical concepts in data structures and algorithms in computer
        science while providing coverage of practical implementation (coding)
        issues.

        <h2>Algorithm Design</h2>
        <p>
          This book introduces algorithms by looking at the real-world problems
          that motivate them. The book teaches a range of design and analysis
          techniques for problems that arise in computing applications.

          Scientists deliver quantum algorithm to develop new materials and
          chemistry
        </h2>
        <p>
          U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) scientists published the Cascaded
          Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE) algorithm in a recent Physical
          Review Research article, expected to become a powerful tool to
          investigate the physical properties in electronic systems.

        <h2>AI ethics are ignoring children, say researchers</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers have called for a more considered approach when embedding
          ethical principles in the development and governance of AI for
          children.

        <h2>Future AI algorithms have potential to learn like humans</h2>
        <p>
          Memories can be as tricky to hold onto for machines as they can be for
          humans. To help understand why artificial agents develop holes in
          their own cognitive processes, electrical engineers have analyzed how
          much a process called 'continual learning' impacts their overall
          performance.
